### "Stop monitoring data. Start making decisions."
LifePulse isn't a dashboard. It's a synthesis layer that turns environmental noise into actionable human directives.

## 🧠 Why LifePulse?
Most platforms show you raw numbers—AQI of 115, 85% Humidity, 10 News Alerts. LifePulse **reasons** across these silos to answer the only question that matters: **"What should I do right now?"**

* **Synthesis:** Correlates Weather, AQI, and News in real-time.
* **The Verdict:** Replaces complex charts with clear, instructional directives.
* **Personalized Profile:** Tailors risk assessment based on your health thresholds stored in PostgreSQL.

## 💎 The Ecosystem

### 🛡️ The Intelligence (Backend)
Powered by **Python (FastAPI)**, our reasoning engine runs weighted algorithms to calculate the "Environmental Pulse." It doesn't just fetch data; it evaluates the *impact* of that data on human safety.

### 🌊 The Interface (Frontend)
A premium **React + Vite** experience. Using **Glassmorphism** and a dynamic **Bento Grid** layout, the UI reflects the current risk level through a "breathing" aura—shifting from calm Emerald to a high-alert Crimson.

### 🏛️ The Foundation (Database)
A robust **PostgreSQL** layer tracks historical trends and stores user-specific health profiles, allowing the engine to learn and refine its reasoning over time.

## 🚀 Key Reasoning Capabilities

| Input Variables | The "LifePulse" Reasoning | The Actionable Verdict |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AQI + Wind Speed** | Predicts if pollution is clearing or settling. | *"Optimal window for outdoor exercise in 2 hours."* |
| **Heat + Humidity** | Calculates the 'RealFeel' against health profiles. | *"High respiratory risk. Keep windows closed."* |
| **News + Location** | Scans for local alerts (wildfires, storms, safety). | *"Avoid downtown route due to active alerts."* |

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
* **Bento Grid 2.0:** Modern, organized, and hierarchy-first.
* **Contextual Aura:** The background pulses with the "heartbeat" of your city.
* **Zero Noise:** Only the most critical information is shown.
